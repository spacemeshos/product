# Spacemesh Project Roadmap

## Q4 2017
- [x] Go-spacemesh App scaffolding.
- [x] Core p2p protocol.
- [x] Core data structures.
- [x] Initial project specs.
- [x] Support for accounts.
- [x] Node gRPC and Cloud API for Gateway.

## Q1 2018
- [x] Core p2p and node capabilities.

## Milestone 1  - Q2 2018
- [x] Published [White Paper 1](https://spacemesh.io/whitepaper1/) with initial protocols tech specs.

## Milestone 2 - Q3 2019
- [x] Publish [Spacemesh Protocol 1.0](https://spacemesh.io/spacemesh-protocol-v1-0/).
- [x] Launch local Testnet for developers with a CLI wallet and CLI full node. See [Local Testnet](https://testnet.spacemesh.io/#/local).

## Milestone 3 - Q4 2019
- [x] Full node and proof of elapsed time service code complete.

- [x] Simple proof of space protocol finalized and e-print published. Presented at crypto 2019.

- [x] Running closed Testnet with 1,500 nodes across several world regions, bootstrap nodes and a PoET service.

- [x] SVM - A Wasm-based smart contracts runtime alpha code-complete.

- [x] Proof of space GPU setup library for Windows and Linux code-complete.

- [x] Spacemesh Desktop App 0.1 for Windows, OS X and Linux Code Complete and in testing.

## Milestone 4 - Spacemesh 0.1 Testnet Soft Launch - Q1 2020 - [TN1](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/milestone/6)
### Focus: LEARNINGS
- [x] Launch open Testnet with the [Spacemesh 0.1 product](https://testnet.spacemesh.io) for all three major desktop platforms.
- [x] Build and run full node from source (go-spacemesh + CLI wallet) instead of using the App.

## Milestone 5 - Spacemesh 0.2 Testnet Updates - Q3 2020 - [TN2](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/milestone/9)
### Focus: FUNCTIONALITY
- [ ] Launch dashboard and an automated Tap.
- [ ] Launch testnet rewards programs and the Spacemesh store.
- [ ] Support wallet-only mode in the Spacemesh app.
- [ ] Support adjustable PoST commitment sizes per node and GPU PoST init.
- [ ] Programability - Smart wallet apps running on SVM and smart wallet transactions.
- [ ] Implement consensus protocol updates.

## Milestone 6 - Spacemesh 0.3 - Q4 2020 - [TN3](https://github.com/spacemeshos/go-spacemesh/milestone/8)
### Focus: SECURITY
- [ ] Launch full mesh explorer.
- [ ] Conduct security audit and bug bounties program.
- [ ] Fix all critical issues found in audit and in Spacemesh 0.2.

## Milestone 7 - Spacemesh 0.3.5 Release Candidate - Q3/Q4 2020
### Focus: GENESIS
- [ ] Launch release candidate for final testing before mainnet genesis.

> *Caveat*: we are only going to launch a Mainnet supporting the Spacemesh Coin cryptocurrency once we have obtained a high-degree of confidence in the security of our platform. This means both full published theoretical proofs for all of the protocols and the security of the Spacemesh node implementation.
